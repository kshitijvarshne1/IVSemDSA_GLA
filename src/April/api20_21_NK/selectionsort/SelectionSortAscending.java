/*
The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

1) The subarray which is already sorted. ( initially it is empty )
2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.*/
